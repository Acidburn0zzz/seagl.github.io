Our Call for Participation is Open!

The Seattle GNU/Linux Conference is now seeking presenters. We want to present a
diverse and welcoming conference. We're also interested in hearing from people
who don't regularly present at conferences and people who have never presented
before. If has something to do with GNU/Linux or free and open source software
and you're excited about it -- then we're excited about it! Below are some of
the things that we think our audience wants to hear about:

 * How to get invloved in free/open source software
 * Dev/Ops - both beginner and advanced topics
 * Career tips and strategies
 * Web development tools and strategies 
 * Policy and licensing that affects free and open source software development
 * Hardware, Embedded Linux or the Internet of Things
 * Scaling and optimizing GNU/Linux 
 * The "cloud" and other distributed services
 * Building free and open source communities
 * Using free software at home, work or school
 * Security and privacy online 
 * Anything else that you think would be interested to new or seasoned GNU/Linux enthusiasts!

We look forward to seeing you this fall in Seattle!
