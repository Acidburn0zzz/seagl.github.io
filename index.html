    <h1>SeaGL 2013</h1>
    <p class="lead">The 2013 Seattle GNU/Linux Conference occurred on October 11th and 12th at <a href="http://seattlecentral.edu/sccc/">Seattle Central Community College</a> (<a href="/maps/2013.html">Maps</a>). The event was an overwhelming success!</p>
    <p class="lead">SeaGL is a grassroots technical conference dedicated to spreading awareness and knowledge about the GNU/Linux eco system, Free Software, and the Open Source movement. We have enjoyed down-to-earth conferences like LinuxFest Northwest for many years, and we feel that the Puget Sound region deserves a similar event for the second half of the year. Our goal for SeaGL is to produce an event which is as enjoyable and informative for those who spend their days maintaining hundreds of servers as it is for a student who has only just started exploring technology options. SeaGL's first year was 2013.</p>
    <p><strong>The cost of attendance was free.</strong></p>

        <p>
          We can't do what we need to do without the support of the community. If you would like to offer
          financial support but don't need an exhibit table, please send an email to
