            The {{ site.custom.year }} Seattle GNU/Linux Conference is scheduled
            for <strong>{{ site.custom.dates }}</strong>
            at {{ site.custom.a.location }} (<a href="/maps/{{ site.custom.year }}.html">Maps</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            SeaGL is a grassroots technical conference dedicated to spreading
            awareness and knowledge about the GNU/Linux community and
            free/libre/open-source software/hardware. Our goal for SeaGL is to
            produce an event which is as enjoyable and informative for those who
            spend their days maintaining hundreds of servers as it is for a
            student who has only just started exploring technology options.
            SeaGL's first year was 2013.

            <strong>Attendee Registration will not require the use of non-free software.</strong>

        We will have a small hall available for exhibitors.  Free tables will be
        available for free/libre/open-source software/hardware and Non-Profit
        organizations, and there are several sponsorship levels for everyone
        else.  If your organization would like an exhibit table at SeaGL, please
        send an email to {{ site.custom.a.email.sponsor }} for our vendor
        prospectus.

      <p>
        Exhibitor space is limited, please contact us right away if you are

      <p>
        We can't do what we need to do without the support of the community. If
        you would like to offer financial support but don't need an exhibit
        table, please send an email to {{ site.custom.a.email.sponsor }}.
